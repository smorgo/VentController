# VentController
<p>Code and hardware resources for my IoT Vent Controller, intended to control automatic conservatory roof vents (but equally applicable to many similar use cases).</p>
<p>The system is based around the ESP8266 microcontroller. I'm currently using it in its SparkFun ESP8266 Thing guise, but the board could be reworked to suit any of the ESP12-derived boards out there.</p>
<p>You can find the Eagle schematic and board files in the Eagle folder.</p>
<p>Initially, I was intended to use the NodeMCU firmware for the ESP8266. However, that simply takes too much memory and caused immense frustration, so I've moved to using the Arduino IDE and programming in C++. The NodeMCU source files are just here for reference.</p>
